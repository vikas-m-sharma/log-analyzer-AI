1. Error Meaning:
   - The first error, "Database connection failed", indicates that the application was unable to establish a connection with the database.
   - The second error, "FATAL Application crashed", suggests that the application has terminated abnormally due to an unhandled exception or critical error. In this case, the crash was likely caused by the failure to connect to the database.

2. Why it happened:
   - The database connection failure can be caused by several reasons such as incorrect database credentials (e.g., wrong host, username, password), network issues, or database server not running.
   - In this specific case, without more context or information about the code and configuration, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause of the error. However, the traceback provided suggests that there is a problem with establishing the connection to the database.

3. How to fix it:
   - To resolve the issue, you should first verify that your database credentials (host, username, password) are correct and the database server is running. You can test the connection using a tool like MySQL Workbench or the command line interface (CLI).
   - If the connection works fine from the CLI but not in your application, check if you're using the correct library for connecting to the database (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL) and ensure that it is properly installed and imported in your Python script.
   - If you're still experiencing issues, examine your code related to establishing the connection to the database and look for potential errors such as incorrect syntax or missing arguments.
   - Lastly, consider implementing error handling around the database connection code to catch exceptions and log them appropriately, allowing you to diagnose and fix issues more easily in the future.
